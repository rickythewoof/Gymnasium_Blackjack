# Gymnasium Blackjack
The repository contains the work to create a suitable Reinforcement Learning algorithm, applied to the toy environment of Blackjack. This uses both the classic version of the Tabular Q-Learning approach, and
the Deep Q-Learning ones. In out are present both files from the dql and tabular learning output

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (tested on 3.8)
- pip package manager


## How to Run
1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. Install required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (see below)
3. Run the script using `python main.py`

## Installing Requirements
### Using pip
Create a new virtual environment: `python -m venv env`

Install packages from `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Notes
- Make sure you have the latest version of pip installed by running `pip install --upgrade pip`
- `main.py` runs the tabular q-learning algorithm, while `deep.py` runs the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
